// viewportResync.js — keeps Kaplay's canvas geometry honest across RESUME and ROTATION.
//
// Why this exists: Kaplay runs letterbox+stretch and recomputes the letterbox from
// canvas.offsetWidth/Height via a ResizeObserver on the canvas (vendor/kaplay-3001.0.19.js). That
// observer has two properties that bite on iOS:
//   1. it EARLY-RETURNS when the box dimensions are unchanged (it caches lastWidth/lastHeight), and
//   2. it DEFERS the actual recompute to the engine's next input tick (`events.onOnce("input")`).
//
// Two symptoms, one root cause — a stale letterbox nobody recomputes:
//
//   • RESUME. Send the installed PWA to Home in LANDSCAPE and reopen it: only two flat colour bands
//     showed (the body #26325c below a too-short canvas) and the menu never appeared. The canvas box
//     doesn't change across that transition, so (1) keeps the observer silent and Kaplay keeps the
//     dimensions it latched during the transient resume viewport. The DOM audio button stayed
//     correctly placed the whole time, proving the viewport itself was fine.
//
//   • ROTATION. Rotating the device while playing sometimes left the game frozen/blank until the
//     player rotated back and forth again. Nothing in the app listened for `resize` or
//     `orientationchange` at all — recovery was left entirely to that same observer. iOS reports
//     INTERMEDIATE viewport sizes mid-rotation, so it can latch one of those and then, if the final
//     size happens to match something it already saw, never correct it (1). And because the recompute
//     waits for an input tick (2), a scene throttled to PERF.IDLE_FPS/FROZEN_FPS (30 or 10 fps —
//     menu, pause, finale) takes up to 100ms per attempt. Rotating twice worked because it forced a
//     fresh, different box size.
//
// The fix, shared by both paths: briefly PIN the canvas to the true current viewport
// (window.innerWidth/innerHeight), then hand sizing back to the stylesheet. That box change makes
// the observer fire at correct dimensions — the same recompute the manual double-rotation forced.
// Because iOS settles the viewport over a few hundred ms, we repeat the pass on a short schedule
// instead of once, and we temporarily UNCAP the frame loop so the deferred recompute actually gets
// its input tick promptly.
//
// Emulation can't reproduce the WebKit latch (Edge/Chromium don't drop the context), so the real
// fix is verified on a physical iPhone; the logic is harmless if it ever runs when nothing was wrong.

 * transitioning, so a single pass can pin the WRONG size. Re-running at ~150ms and ~450ms lands at
 * least one pass on the final geometry. While passes are pending we also uncap the frame loop —
 * Kaplay's resize recompute waits for an input tick, and an idle/frozen scene ticks at 10-30fps.
 * The scene re-asserts its own cap on entry, so restoring the active `maxFPS` here leaks no state.
