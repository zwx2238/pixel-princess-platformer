// modest mobile GPU. Rendering the virtual 1280×720 world at 2× there means a ~2560×1440
// backbuffer — ~4× the fragment/fill work of density 1 — which makes the game feel "scattoso"
// (choppy) on iOS. Since the art is nearest-neighbour pixel art scaled to full-screen anyway,
// dropping to density 1 on mobile is barely perceptible visually but vastly smoother. Desktop
// keeps min(dpr, 2) for crisp HUD text where the GPU budget is there.
// Exported so gameplay can lighten per-frame work on touch devices (e.g. fewer ambient
// particles — see src/scenes/game.js), where the GPU/CPU budget is tighter than desktop.
// Detect touch/mobile robustly: `pointer: coarse` is the usual signal, but some iOS browser
// configs report it inconsistently — `navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0` is true on every iPhone/iPad,
// so OR-ing it in guarantees the mobile render path (density 1, fewer particles, fps cap) actually
// engages on the device. A desktop with a touchscreen also takes this path — a harmless trade.

// Why measured, not assumed: a fixed 60 cap is smooth on a 120Hz ProMotion iPhone (Rt = 1/60, so it
// renders every 2nd refresh, evenly) but BEATS against a 60Hz panel — many non-Pro iPhones and
// touch laptops. The loop renders only when `accumulated > 1/maxFPS`; when the cap ≈ the refresh,
// frame-timing jitter periodically fails that check and skips a frame, which reads as a micro-
// stutter — worst during a jump's smooth arc (the exact symptom reported). A 60Hz panel is already
// smooth UNCAPPED (and can't exceed 60 anyway), so the cap there is pure downside. So: sample the
// refresh once at boot, then UNCAP ≤70Hz panels and cap high-refresh ones to render every 2nd
// frame (≈ half the refresh, nudged up a hair so the accumulator's `>` reliably clears two frame
// periods without occasionally slipping to a third). Desktop stays uncapped (GPU budget); a
// ?maxfps= override is never touched. The probe finishes during loading/menu (both throttled to
// PERF.IDLE_FPS), so the tuned value is in place well before the first level reads it on entry.
